        <h2>CSS</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
       <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. Theyâ€™re useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
       <li>It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger!</li>
       <li>A star * lets you add the same properties to all elements on a page</Li>
       <li> Two selectors can be combined into a single rule using a comma</li>
       <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
