        <h2>CSS</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
       <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
       <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
       <li>It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
       <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger!</li>
       <li>A star * lets you add the same properties to all elements on a page</Li>
       <li> Two selectors can be combined into a single rule using a comma</li>
       <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>

      <li>Every project on Git is called a repository or repository</li>
      <li>A branch is a workspace where you can make changes without affecting the main site</li>
      <li>Markdown md is a way of writing in plain text that can be easily converted to HTML https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists</li>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

       <li>JavaScript (JS) allows users to interact with websites.</li>
       <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</li>
       <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
       <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
       <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code.</li>
       <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
       <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
       <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.</li>
       <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
       <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics</li>
       <li>The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
       <li>.log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
