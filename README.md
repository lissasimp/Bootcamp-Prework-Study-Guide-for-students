# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for students who are enrolled in the Front End Developer Course. It outlines key information from the four sections covered in order to build a website. These are HTML, CSS, Github and JavaScript. This is a study guide which can be referred to as students continue throuh Bootcamp. I learnt the basics of HTML (foundations of a house); CSS (adding design features such as font size and colour); Github (how to create a list of issues, using Gitbash; creating and merging branches; making commits) and JavaScript (creating Code and using ChromeDev tools). I also learned how to debug problems (such as port 22; shortcuts) and how to use the find/replace tool.
